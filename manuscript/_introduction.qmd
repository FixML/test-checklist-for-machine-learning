- Problem with software robustness with applied machine learning code. 
Include and cite examples where non-robust code
has led to negative societal and economic impacts 
(e.g., misinformation [@Ashley2024], social bias [@Alice2023], 
substantial financial losses [@Asheeta2019], and safety hazards [@David2023])
- Checklists as a solution to safety critical systems [@gawande2010checklist]
- Checklists impact in machine learning reproducibility [@pineau2021improving]
- Goal: a checklist for tests for applied machine learning projects
- Scope: test checklist is aimed at applications of machine learning,
not new machine learning methodologies. 
In future, a checklist for that could be developed, 
but that is out of scope for this paper.
- Potential impact: guide for practitioners, code reviewers, educators, 
as well as LLM prompts starting points for automated code test suite evaluation 
and automated test data and software test generation.
