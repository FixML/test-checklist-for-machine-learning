- Recall goal: a checklist for tests for applied machine learning projects
- Highlight # of checklist items, and number across each test category
- Summarize findings from evaluation of $n$ applied machine learning projects 
with regards to the checklist
- Discuss potential immediate applications of checklist
  - professional data analysts/machine learning engineers 
  working on applied machine learning projects 
  (guide in the actual writing of tests)
  - Senior tech leads evaluating their team's applied machine learning project
  - Data science educators grading student projects
  - Data science students working on their own projects 
  (guide in the actual writing of tests)
- Discuss further off applications of the checklist:
  - a source for engineering large-language model (LLM) prompts 
  that act as reliable starting points for evaluating the quality 
  of existing machine learning code
  - a source for engineering large-language model (LLM) prompts 
  that generate code for reproducible test data and software tests themselves 
  for each item on the checklist
