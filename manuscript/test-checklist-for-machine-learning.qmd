    Checklists have been shown to decrease errors 
    in safety critical systems (Gawande 2010), 
    and the use of a reproducibility checklist 
    at the Machine Learning NeurIPS 2019 conference led to an increase 
    in the percentage of authors submitting the code for their work 
    (from 50% to 75%; Pineau et al. 2021). 
    Thus, in an effort to make applied machine learning software more trustworthy
    by increasing its robustness, 
    we aimed to create a general and robust checklist 
    for software tests for applied machine learning code. 
    This checklist includes tests for data presence, quality 
    and ingestion at the beginning of the analysis, 
    the model fitting and evaluation, 
    as well as tests for the artifacts (presence and quality) 
    which are created by the analysis. 
    The test checklist items were derived from software tests
    for applied machine learning code which either industry, 
    or the scholarly literature have deemed as important
    for correct and robust applied machine learning software,
    as well as from examining things that commonly go wrong 
    in machine learning code (threat model).
    Such a checklist may be used by data scientists and machine learning engineers
    to guide the manual writing of tests.
    It may also act as a source for engineering large-language model (LLM) prompts 
    that act as reliable starting points for evaluating the quality 
    of existing applied machine learning code, as well as for
    engineering reproducible test data 
    and software tests themselves for each item on the checklist.
